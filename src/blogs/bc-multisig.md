# Golang SQLC


The issue of hygiene was very evident. Food was prepared with poor sanitation practices. 
They had problems with washing their hands and vegetables properly. 
Every time I bought food from the mami market, I would get food poisoning. 
I tried different food vendors, but nothing changed. It wasn’t just me; everyone who wasn’t used to the environment experienced the same thing. Excessive use of ‘white maggi’ contributed to the countless bouts of food poisoning. Ohhhh how the Hausas love their maggi! They would cook food with an excess of seasoning cubes and ‘Ajinomoto’. 

```js
function main()  {
    return "Hello man"
}
```
